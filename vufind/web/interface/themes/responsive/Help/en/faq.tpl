<div class='faqQuestion'>Q. What are holds?</div>
<div class='faqAnswer'>A. Holds allow you to request that a title be delivered to your home library.
	Once the title arrives at your library you will be sent an e-mail, receive a phone call, or receive a postcard informing you that the title is ready for you.
	You will then have 8 days to pickup the title from your home library.</div>

<div class='faqQuestion'>Q. I placed a hold, how long will it take to get here?</div>
<div class='faqAnswer'>A. Holds are filled in the order they were placed as people return copies of the title.
	Items owned by a library go to patrons of that library first.  If no patrons of the library have a hold on the title it may be transferred to another library for usage.</div>

<div class='faqQuestion'>Q. How can I keep a book longer?</div>
<div class='faqAnswer'>A. To keep a book longer, login to your account and renew titles from your list of Checked Out titles.  </div>

<div class='faqQuestion'>Q. Why can't I renew online books?</div>
<div class='faqAnswer'>A. Due to restrictions with the protection system, eBooks and Audio Books cannot be renewed.
	However, if no one else has placed a hold on the title you can checkout the title again (and download it again).
	If someone else has placed a hold on the title you will need to place a hold on the title and wait for it to become available again. </div>
